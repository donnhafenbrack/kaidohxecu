I would like to try them , but I don´t want to get banned by punkbuster. So I recently upgraded my monitor from an Asus PB278q(60hz 1440p), to an Asus PG279Q and I am struggling seeing enemies unless I turn my brightness on my monitor up to at least 60, if not more, but then it's so bright it literally makes my head hurt. I have always followed the calibration on TFT's website to calibrate my monitor and tweak from there but with Battlefield 5 I can hardly see anyone. I've turned my in game brightness up to 100 but unless I turn my monitor brightness up to a minimu. Battlefield 3 SweetFX/ReShade Graphics Mod Awesome!! 4K UltraHD  Nvidia Geforce Gtx 1070 Ti.

There is a way to "disable" TAA but you'll have to have 1% motion blur enabled, which creates a situation. 
Both boot into the game with a white screen. I'm using the latest version of reshade 12 Battlefield 3: pastebin.com/F8UeH. The game plays great but blurry render distance ruins everything. At 1080p at distance you can't see anything unless you renderscale it at 140% and maybe use sharpening filter with reshade. In battlefield 1 I only use a render scale of 120 and in game settings which looks sharper than bfv.

I am really curious, it's not like the game looks bad, but it looks bland in my opinion. Even with the ReShade in place I feel like something is lacking. I know - realism and all, and that Battlefield is intentionally overcameronized, but seriously it lacks something and I cannot tell what. Perhaps better and more diverse textures and vegetation?

Everything is VERY blurry, I'm even using Reshade to help native anti aliasing (which is a pretty scum in his job), but I never played a survival/fps game so blurry (not arma, not dayz, not battlefield, not csgo, etc.). Maybe I've something wrong in setting (everything on very low excpet for Texture ad Ultra and AA at medium) but there is some witchcraft to improve this?
